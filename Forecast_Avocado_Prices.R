# Seasonality (Y), Multiplicative over time?
# Looking at the plot, prices of avocados are highest during US peak growing season ,
# trailing off into the forth quarter (calendar year). 
# The peak growing season is April through September, corresponding to price increasing,
# overall, during this time through the end of the third quarter. 
# Question - What happened during 2015 or was this the beginning of an increase in 
# popularity and demand of avocados? Also noting, 2018 has started at higher average prices. 
# Conservatively, I would expect the same shape for 2018 data. Dip in prices in the coldest 
# months (although in general the average price during that time may be higher than previous 
# years (popularity increase?), then an increase (growing season), trailing off into Q4, 
# beginning of US winter.

# A stationary time series is one whose STATISTICAL properties do not depend on the time at 
# which the series is observed. Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, 
# are not stationary.... (Forecasting: P rinciples and Practice)

# FURTHERMORE...
# In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. 
# Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behavior 
# is possible), with constant variance.
